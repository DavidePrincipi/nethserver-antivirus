# Additional Sanesecruity distributed database that can be used and
# their associated potential fales-positive ratings:
#
# USE 'ONLY' ONE OF THE FOLLOWING TWO SIGNATURE DATABASES:
#
# INetMsg-SpamDomains-2w.ndb    : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# INetMsg-SpamDomains-2m.ndb    : MEDIUM false-positive rating
#
# ONE DATABASE CONTAINS THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF COLLECTED SPAM DOMAINS (2w), AND
# THE OTHER DATABASE CONTAINS THE LAST TWO MONTHS OF COLLECTED SPAM DOMAINS (2m).
#
# jurlbla.ndb                   : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# lott.ndb                      : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# spam.ldb                      : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# spear.ndb                     : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# scamnailer.ndb                : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# winnow.complex.patterns.ldb   : MEDIUM false-positive rating

# winnow_phish_complete_url.ndb : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# winnow_spam_complete.ndb      : MEDIUM false-positive rating
#
# USE 'ONLY' ONE OF THE FOLLOWING TWO SIGNATURE DATABASES:
#
# winnow_phish_complete.ndb     : HIGH false-positive rating
# winnow_phish_complete_url.ndb : MEDIUM false-positive rating
#
# ONE CONTAINS THE COMPLETE URL PATH (MEDIUM RISK), AND THE OTHER
# CONTAINS ONLY THE URL, WITHOUT THE FULL PATH (HIGH RISK).

# Since the SecuriteInfo databases are only updated a few time each
# month, set a time interval to do database update checks.
si_update_hours="4"   # Default is 4 hours (6 update checks daily).

# MalwarePatrol Database(s)
# =========================
# Add or remove database file names between quote marks as needed.  To
# disable any of the MalwarePatrol database file downloads, remove the
# appropriate database file name lines below.  To disable MalwarePatrol
# database downloads, comment all of the following lines.

# Since the MalwarePatrol database file is dynamically created,
# there is no way to test for changes prior to downloading.  For this
# reason, you will need to set a reasonable time interval in "hours"
# for MBL database file downloads.  As shown below, this has been
# set to update every "6" hours, which seems appropriate (that's 4
# file downloads per day)  Change only if you REALLY feel you must.
# However, I would not suggest going below every 4 hour lest you risk
# being blacklisted by the MalwarePatrol site.
mbl_update_hours="6"   # Default is 6 hours (4 downloads daily).

# Additional signature databases can be specified here in the following
# format: PROTOCOL://URL-or-IP/PATH/TO/FILE-NAME (use a trailing "/" in
# place of the "FILE-NAME" to download all files from specified location,
# but this *ONLY* works for files downloaded via rsync).  For non-rsync
# downloads, curl is used.  For download protocols supported by curl, see
# "man curl".  This also works well for locations that have many ClamAV
# servers that use 3rd party signature databases, as only one server need
# download the remote databases, and all others can update from the local
# mirror's copy.  See format examples below.  To use, remove the comments
# and examples shown and add your own sites between the quote marks.
